# SumBuddy: Your AI-Powered Telegram Assistant for Smarter Reading
Ever stumbled upon an interesting article but didnâ€™t have the time to read it? Weâ€™ve all been there. Thatâ€™s exactly why I built SumBuddy, a Telegram bot that summarizes articles for you in seconds.

Instead of skimming through long texts or bookmarking articles youâ€™ll never return to, just send the link to SumBuddy, and it will generate a summary tailored to your needs. Whether you want a quick one-liner, a structured breakdown, or an engaging story-style summary, SumBuddy has you covered.

### How It Works
Using AI-powered natural language processing (NLP), SumBuddy extracts key points from any article and condenses them into **3 different styles**:

* A **one-liner** for a quick takeaway.

* A **professional** summary for structured insights.

* A **story mode** version that reads like a short engaging narrative.

The bot is powered by **Googleâ€™s FLAN-T5 model**, which helps generate human-like summaries while preserving context and meaning.

### Building the Bot
Developing SumBuddy wasnâ€™t just about connecting a summarization model to Telegramâ€”it involved handling real-world challenges like text extraction, unsupported websites, and multi-language detection. The bot automatically warns users when an article isnâ€™t supported (like Medium links) and informs them when non-English content is detected.

For deployment, I initially hosted the bot on Railway, but after facing issues with disappearing environments, I moved it to Render, ensuring stable **24/7 availability**. Security was also a key priority, so the bot token is managed through environment variables to prevent accidental exposure.

### Whatâ€™s Next?
Iâ€™m constantly improving SumBuddy, with **multi-language summarization and PDF support** being next on the roadmap. The goal is to make it even more useful for people who want quick and insightful summaries without the hassle of reading entire articles.

### Want to Try It?
SumBuddy is live and ready to help! You can chat with the bot here and test out its summarization capabilities.
